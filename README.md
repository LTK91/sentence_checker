# sentence_checker

Assesses whether a sentence is valid based on the following conditions:
- First letter must be capitalised;
- Last letter must be "?", "!" or ".";
- Must contain an even number of quotation marks;
- Only valid location for "." is at the end of a sentence; and
- All numbers below 13 must be written as words (e.g. "twelve" rather than "12").

Includes a dummy logger that prints to console.
